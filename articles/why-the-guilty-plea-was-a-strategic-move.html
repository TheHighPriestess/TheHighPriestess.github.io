  <h1>Why Jeff Dahmer's Plea Change Was a Brilliant Strategic Move</h1>
  <p><em>Originally published on The Dahmer Case Substack</em></p>

  <p><strong>Date:</strong> February 4, 2025</p>

  <p>Jeff Dahmer was not a serial killer. He was a victim of human trafficking.

<p>This conclusion is not based on speculation but on evidence gathered from public records, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, declassified documents, and undeniable video evidence.</p>

<p>This is all open-source intelligence. You can verify these findings yourself because we tell you where to look.</p>
