  <h1>Why Jeff Dahmer's Plea Change Was a Brilliant Strategic Move</h1>
  <p><em>Originally published on The Dahmer Case Substack</em></p>

  <p><strong>Date:</strong> February 4, 2025</p>

  <p>Jeff Dahmer was not a serial killer. He was a victim of human trafficking.</p>

<p>This conclusion is not based on speculation but on evidence gathered from public records, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, declassified documents, and undeniable video evidence.</p>

<p>This is all open-source intelligence. You can verify these findings yourself because we tell you where to look.</p>

<h2>What I Believe To Be True About Jeff Dahmer</h2>
<h3>Steven Hicks died in 1978, but his death was accidental.</h3>
<p>The death of Steven Hicks, Jeff's first alleged victim, was not a murder but an accident. The sources suggest that alcohol and a motor vehicle driven by Jeff may have been involved. For more information, see Jeff Dahmer's $10 Million Judgment: Why Did His Parents Escape Liability?</p>  
<h3>The Dahmer family covered up Steven Hicks’ accidental death.</h3>
<p>The Dahmer family was in a state of turmoil at the time of Steven Hicks' accidental death. Lionel and Joyce Dahmer were in the process of divorcing, and there was a custody battle over Jeff's younger brother, David. Lionel was living in a motel with his then-girlfriend, Shari. Given these circumstances, it looks like the family covered up the accidental death of Steven Hicks to avoid having to deal with it. In other words, they had enough problems and didn’t need another one.</p>
