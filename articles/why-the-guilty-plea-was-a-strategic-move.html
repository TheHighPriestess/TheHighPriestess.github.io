  <h1>Why Jeff Dahmer's Plea Change Was a Brilliant Strategic Move</h1>
  <p><em>Originally published on The Dahmer Case Substack</em></p>

  <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 18, 2025</p>

  <p>Jeff Dahmer initially pleaded not guilty but later, on September 10, 1991, changed his plea to guilty but insane.</p>

  <p>Since the case was entirely fabricated, the plea change from "not guilty" to "guilty but insane" was a masterful tactical decision. Let me break down why this worked so effectively:</p>

  <h2>1. No Need to Produce Physical Evidence</h2>
  <p>When a defendant pleads guilty, prosecutors don't have to show physical evidence to prove the crimes occurred.</p>

  <p>If you were creating a fake serial killer case, your biggest challenge would be producing actual bodies, murder weapons, blood evidence, and crime scene photos. A regular trial would require all this evidence to be presented in court, examined by experts, and potentially challenged by the defense.</p>

  <p>But when Jeff pled guilty, this problem magically disappeared. The prosecution no longer had to produce the actual physical evidence of murders and dismemberments—they only needed Jeff Dahmer's confession and some supporting testimony.</p>

  <h2>2. The Guilty Plea Manufactured Public Consensus</h2>
  <p>It created an unchallengeable media narrative: “He confessed, he’s guilty, it’s over.” That shuts down public curiosity, FOIA requests, and legal scrutiny.</p>

  <h2>3. Insanity Cloaked the Absurdities</h2>
  <p>By pleading guilty but insane, Dahmer’s confession—which included bizarre claims like using hydrochloric acid in a tiny apartment—was shielded from serious cross-examination.</p>

  <p><em>The less you have to prove, the more a fake story can survive.</em></p>
