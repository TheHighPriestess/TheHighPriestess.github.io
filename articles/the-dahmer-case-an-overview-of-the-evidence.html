  <h1>The Dahmer Case: An Overview of the Evidence</h1>
  <p><em>Originally published on The Dahmer Case Substack</em></p>

  <p><strong>Date:</strong> February 4, 2025</p>

  <p>Jeff Dahmer was not a serial killer. He was a victim of human trafficking.</p>

<p>This conclusion is not based on speculation but on evidence gathered from public records, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, declassified documents, and undeniable video evidence.</p>

<p>This is all open-source intelligence. You can verify these findings yourself because we tell you where to look.</p>

<h2>What I Believe To Be True About Jeff Dahmer</h2>
<h3>Steven Hicks died in 1978, but his death was accidental.</h3>
<p>The death of Steven Hicks, Jeff's first alleged victim, was not a murder but an accident. The sources suggest that alcohol and a motor vehicle driven by Jeff may have been involved. For more information, see Jeff Dahmer's $10 Million Judgment: Why Did His Parents Escape Liability?</p>  
<h3>The Dahmer family covered up Steven Hicks’ accidental death.</h3>
<p>The Dahmer family was in a state of turmoil at the time of Steven Hicks' accidental death. Lionel and Joyce Dahmer were in the process of divorcing, and there was a custody battle over Jeff's younger brother, David. Lionel was living in a motel with his then-girlfriend, Shari. Given these circumstances, it looks like the family covered up the accidental death of Steven Hicks to avoid having to deal with it. In other words, they had enough problems and didn’t need another one.</p>
<h3>At some point, Jeff Dahmer confessed to participating in covering up Steven Hicks’ accidental death.</h3>
<p>Given that the key players were all connected to the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, it’s possible that Jeff confessed to someone associated with the Archdiocese. That confession led to Jeff eventually starring in a fake news story about a “gay serial killer”.</p>
<h2>Why I Don’t Believe The “Serial Killer” Story Told By The MSM</h2> 
<h3>There are no signed guilty pleas.</h3>  
<p>A request to the Wisconsin Circuit Court revealed that the 15 signed guilty pleas that were televised do not actually exist. Without any signed guilty pleas, it cannot be said that Jeff Dahmer murdered anyone in Milwaukee.
<h3>Jeff Dahmer’s confession contains another man’s SSN.</h3>
<p>Jeff Dahmer’s confession contained another man's Social Security Number (SSN). That man’s name is Eric Lamar Stanley. If you have access to Ancestry.com, you can verify this for yourself. The Milwaukee Police knew this because the FBI told them. Despite this, the SSN was never corrected on the confession.

<h2>Jeff Dahmer’s confession was not recorded.</h2>  
<p>Over 60 hours of alleged discussions with Detective Murphy were not taped or video recorded; instead, they relied on handwritten notes. The confession is the only key physical evidence admitted at the trial.

For more information, see Jeff Dahmer's "Confession" Was Not Taped and Jeff Dahmer's Trial: An Exploration of the Peculiar Legal Process.</p>  
<h2>Alleged victims are missing from the Social Security Death Index (SSDI).</h2>  
<p>Fifteen of the alleged victims are not listed in the Social Security Death Index. Assuming they all had a Social Security Number (They were all Americans), this means their deaths weren’t reported to the Social Security Administration.

Usually, a family member, attorney, or mortuary files a death benefit application. The SSA might also receive a death report from a funeral home, financial institution, postal authority, or state. So, the fact that 15 of the alleged victims are missing from the SSDI is suspicious. For more information, see 15 Dahmer victims are NOT in the Social Security Death Index (SSDI).</p>  
<h2>Some alleged victims died before or after the timeframe of the alleged murders.</h2>
<p>Richard Guerrero died in 1960, and "Eddie" Smith died in 1999.

<h2>Some alleged victims are still alive.</h2>  
<p>Curtis Straughter is still alive. His real name is Timothy Straughter.

Although Richard Guerrero died in 1960 when he was 6 months old, his brother, Reynaldo Guerrero is still alive and looks like the person the MSM said was Richard.</p>
